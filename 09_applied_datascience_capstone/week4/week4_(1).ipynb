    "As Senior Human Resource Manager, one of the task is to list out several accomodation choices for these expatriates. This time they need to travel 3 different cities: Vienna, Zurich and Vancouver, as these places are just awarded as top 3 which have good quality of living city ranking in 2019 (https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Insights/quality-of-living-rankings). Hence, they need to travel between these places to look for high end business opportunity this year, so accomodation choices have to be studied thoroughly to meet their interest."
